# SwitchCube Executable
 This is the desktop download to play my 2D game SwitchCube for WINDOWS/MAC/LINUX using the Unity Engine.
 This is a 2D platformer I made for an Intro to Game Programming class in 2019. 
 All game assets, scripts, and level design are developed by me with the exception of the music. 
 The music is from "A Hat In Time" developed by Gears for Breakfast.
